# gh3inbatch


Welcome To The Batch World!
Now how do i put this, This
is the experimental version of GH3 IN BATCH!
This is just a version with no ui and you have to program the chart.
If you are a guitar hero fan here you go!
All charts made by me will be in this repository.
Soon enough there will be a tutorial on how to make charts.
Making charts is quite a confusing process but i will try to explain it.
I cant wait for you guys to play this!
To put charts in the game edit the batch file with notepad and paste the code
in the section labeled :play
Make sure you put the folder in the Charts folder.
Well thank you all for downloading and this is version 1.0.0 of GH3 IN BATCH!
